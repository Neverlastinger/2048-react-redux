# The 2048 Game built with React & Redux

This is the 2048 Game I build in 2018 in order to showcase my React & Redux knowledge.

## Building and Running the Project

This project is bootstrapped by create-react-app, so if you want to run it by yourself:

> - Install node.js
> - Run ```npm install``` to download dependencies
> - Run ```npm start``` to load the game on http://localhost:3000/
> - Run ```npm test``` to run tests
> - Run ```npm run build``` to create an optimized build in the build folder and run files locally without a server
